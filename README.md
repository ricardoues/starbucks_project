# Starbucks Portfolio Project from Data Scientist Nanodegree of Udacity


## Introduction

This is a Portfolio Project provided by Udacity and Starbucks. The goal of this project is to analyze a randomized experiment 
that was conducted and the results are in the file 'Training.csv' which has the following variables:

* Treatment: Indicates if the customer was part of treatment or control 
* Purchase: Indicates if the customer purchased the product
* ID: Customer ID
* V1 to V7: features of the customer

In addition to that we have the following information:

* Cost of sending a Promotion: $0.15
* Revenue from purchase of product: $10 (There is only one product)


We need to response the following questions:

1. Analyze the results of the experiment and identify the effect of the Treatment on product purchase and Net Incremental Revenue
2. Build a model to select the best customers to target that maximizes the Incremental Response Rate and Net Incremental Revenue.
